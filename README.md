Digital Signature for PDF using pdfbox-app-2.0.7
as simple as that just download the project and the Test.pfx certificate the password of that certificate from 1 to 6. the code expect a pdf file to sign it. voila the pdf will be digitally signed :).
I build this open source project because i noticed that most of the company need an open source project for digitally signing pdfs
